# Modern React Patterns for 2025

React continues to evolve, and with it, the patterns we use to build maintainable applications. Let's explore some of the most effective patterns for modern React development.

## Component Composition Over Inheritance

React favors composition over inheritance, and this principle has become even more important with hooks.

```jsx
function Button({ children, variant = 'primary', ...props }) {
  return (
    <button className={`btn btn-${variant}`} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse

Custom hooks are one of React's most powerful features for sharing stateful logic between components.

```jsx
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
    const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
    return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
  });

  const setStoredValue = (value) => {
    setValue(value);
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  };

  return [value, setStoredValue];
}
```

## Compound Components

This pattern allows you to create components that work together seamlessly while maintaining flexibility.

The beauty of these patterns lies in their simplicity and reusability. They make your codebase more maintainable and your components more predictable.
