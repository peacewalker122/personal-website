# Building Accessible React Applications

Accessibility should be a cornerstone of every web application. Here's how to build React apps that work for everyone.

## Semantic HTML First

Always start with proper semantic HTML elements before adding React magic.

```jsx
// Good
<button onClick={handleClick}>Submit</button>

// Bad - requires extra ARIA
<div role="button" tabIndex={0} onClick={handleClick}>
  Submit
</div>
```

## Focus Management

Managing focus is crucial for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

```jsx
function Modal({ isOpen, onClose, children }) {
  const focusRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isOpen) {
      focusRef.current?.focus();
    }
  }, [isOpen]);
  
  return isOpen ? (
    <div role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
      <button ref={focusRef} onClick={onClose}>
        Close
      </button>
      {children}
    </div>
  ) : null;
}
```

## Screen Reader Support

Use ARIA attributes appropriately to provide context for assistive technologies.

## Color and Contrast

Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios and don't rely solely on color to convey information.

Building accessible apps isn't just about complianceâ€”it's about creating inclusive experiences for all users.
