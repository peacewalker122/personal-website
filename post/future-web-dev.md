# The Future of Web Development

Web development is constantly evolving, with new frameworks, tools, and paradigms emerging regularly. Let's examine what the future holds.

## Server Components Revolution

React Server Components are changing how we think about client-server boundaries. They allow us to run components on the server, reducing bundle size and improving performance.

## Edge Computing

CDNs are becoming more powerful, allowing us to run code closer to users. This reduces latency and improves user experience globally.

```typescript
// Edge function example
export default async function handler(request: Request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const country = request.headers.get('cf-ipcountry');
  
  return new Response(`Hello from ${country}!`);
}
```

## WebAssembly Integration

WASM is opening new possibilities for web applications, allowing us to run high-performance code in the browser.

## AI-Assisted Development

Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are becoming essential parts of the development workflow, helping with code generation and problem-solving.

The future is exciting, with possibilities we're only beginning to explore.
